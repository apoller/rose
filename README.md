Synopsis
----
ROSE is a browser extension researchers can use to capture in situ data on how users actually use the online social network Facebook.

[Please see the project wiki for more detailed information.](https://github.com/oliverh855/rose/wiki)

Features
----
* Cross-browser compatibility through the [Kango - Cross-browser extension framework](http://kangoextensions.com/)
* Capturing events such as likes, unlikes, comments, sending chat messages or sharing content.
* Comment function enables study participants to comment on their own or others' actions in Facebook
* Easy to adopt to changes in the structure of Facebook's web pages
* Privacy by Design: With the ROSE control center study participants have full control over the data collected. No shared content such as chat messages or images is collected. Captured events have privacy-respecting identifiers to correlate them among study participants (if required), and to relate events and comments. ROSE's privacy-aware design aims on minimizing interferences with the field.
* Bilingual: German and English
