Synopsis
----
ROSE is a browser extension researchers can use to capture in situ data on how users actually use online social networks.

[Please see the project wiki for more detailed information.](https://github.com/secure-software-engineering/rose/wiki)

Features
----
* Currently Supported Social Network Sites: facebook.com
* Capturing user interactions such as likes, unlikes, comments, sending chat messages or sharing content.
* Capturing user activity by mouse move distance, scroll distance, OSN tab focus time, click amount and login status
* Comment function enables study participants to comment on their own or others' actions right in the OSN
* Privacy by Design: With the ROSE control center study participants have full control over the data collected. No shared content such as chat messages or images is collected. Captured events have privacy-respecting identifiers to correlate them among study participants (if required), and to relate events and comments. ROSE's privacy-aware design aims on minimizing interferences with the field.
* Easy to adopt to changes in the structure of OSNs or even add new sites by standardized observer definitions with push update functionality
* Bilingual: English(US) and German(DE)
* Cross-browser compatibility through the [Kango - Cross-browser extension framework](http://kangoextensions.com/)
