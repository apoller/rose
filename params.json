While this is the main purpose of ROSE, the software also implements a complete online research workflow including creating a study with ROSE, deploying a tailored ROSE configuration to participants, and analyzing collected data.\r\n\r\n### So ROSE basically counts clicks in Facebook? That's not very impressive!\r\n\r\nWhile it sounds easy to collect field data the evil is in the details.  \r\n\r\n### Under which license is ROSE published?\r\n\r\nROSE is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
